<h1> PCF Telstra WIFI API Consumer </h1>

The following project can be used to consume the Telstra WIFI Api from a spring boot application. It presents a simple Google Map
which will drill into your current location to allow you to find WIFI HotSppts 

The application can be deployed to Pivotal Web Services (PWS) using a manifest.yml file as follows

```
applications:
- name: pas-telstrawifiapi-client
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  random-route: true
  path: ./target/TelstraWIFIAPIPublic-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urando
```

It can be accessed from a deployed instance on PWS using the link below which will be dependant on the route assigned on PWS.

```
http://pas-telstrawifi.cfapps.io/
```

Finally it will run a mobile devices as well BUT you need to turn on Location based services for your browser to ensure it 
can share the current location with Google MAP
